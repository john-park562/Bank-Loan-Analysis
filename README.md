## Summary of Insights
### Loan Funding and Cash Flow:
* Loan Funding Growth: There’s a steady month-to-month increase in total funded amounts, indicating strong demand.
* Loan Term Preference: 62.66% of loans are for 36-month terms, showing borrower preference for shorter repayment periods.
* Cash Flow Strength: Total amount received ($473.1 million) exceeds total funded amount ($435.8 million), reflecting positive cash flow.
### Borrower Financial Health (Debt-to-Income Ratio Analysis):
* Charged-Off Loans (Avg DTI: 14.00%): Borrowers with charged-off loans have a slightly higher DTI than the portfolio average (13.33%), indicating that higher debt loads may contribute to defaults.
* Current Loans (Avg DTI: 14.72%): Borrowers with current loans have the highest DTI. While they are still making payments, this group carries the most financial strain, suggesting potential future risk if their financial situation worsens.
* Fully Paid Loans (Avg DTI: 13.17%): Borrowers who have fully paid off their loans have the lowest DTI, reflecting healthier financial profiles and better debt management, leading to successful loan repayment.
### Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs:
* Good Loans Issued: 86.2%: The majority of loans issued fall under the "Good Loans" category (fully paid or current), indicating strong portfolio performance and effective loan management.
* Bad Loans Issued: 13.8%: A smaller percentage of loans are categorized as "Bad Loans" (charged-off), but this figure highlights potential risk areas that could impact profitability.
## Recommendations & Next Steps
* Investigate what’s driving the growing demand for loans and the preference for 36-month terms by analyzing borrower demographics, market trends, and loan purposes. Additionally, assess repayment stability by studying borrower behavior across different economic conditions to ensure continued positive cash flow and sustainable growth.
*  Look into tightening DTI limits, monitoring high-DTI current loans for risk, and offering incentives for low-DTI borrowers to reduce defaults and improve portfolio health.
*  Maintain a high proportion of good loans by continuing robust credit assessments while focusing on reducing the percentage of bad loans through improved risk management and borrower support strategies.
